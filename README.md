In a variety of education settings, personalized feedback greatly enhances the learning experience. Intelligent Tutoring Systems provide real-time feedback, but they typically rely on the student to self diagnose the need for help, which may cause an under- or overuse of hints. Consequently, we examined how changing the availability of hints affects their use. In order to do this, we developed an online, multiple choice quiz with five mathematical logic problems. Each problem has two, increasingly specific hints available, and hints are made available through one of various different hint design strategies. We evaluated how feedback availability affects the count, frequency, and timing of its use.
